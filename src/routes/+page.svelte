				"Kenzu compressed our due diligence timeline from 90 days to 45 days on a $180M multifamily acquisition. Their operators identified $2.3M in hidden operational upside that our investment committee hadn't spotted. That accelerated close gave us the competitive edge to win the deal.",

			quote:
				"We brought Kenzu into three struggling office properties in our portfolio. Within 14 months, they increased NOI by 22% across all three assets through operational improvements we didn't have the in-house expertise to execute. That translated to $8.4M in additional value at exit.",

				"Before Kenzu, we were missing critical operational risks during acquisition due diligence. Their team caught deferred maintenance issues and tenant lease vulnerabilities that would have cost us $1.7M post-close. They've become our go-to resource for every real estate deal we evaluate.",
